This is a package for estimating nonlinear in parameters quantile regression models.
The algorithm is originally based on an Splus implementation of Koenker and 
Park (1996, J. Econometrics).   The interface to model specification a la nls()
was very kindly provided by Philippe Grosjean.  It was originally submitted to
CRAN in May, 2001.

Version 0.1-4 (May, 2004)

`	o Added method argument to nlrq() to be passed to optim() at the suggestion of
